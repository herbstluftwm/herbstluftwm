This document describes the progress of migrating hlwm to proper C\+\+11. In
the following, all user-visible changes are listed:

  - Formerly, double dots in object paths were allows (similar to double
    slashes in file paths in unix). Right now, they are only allowed at the end
    (which is necessary for the tab-completion of attr).

    * +monitors+ is valid
    * +monitors.+ is valid
    * +monitors..+ is valid
    * +monitors.by-name.+ is valid
    * +monitors..by-name.+ is *invalid*

 - the 'toggle' command does not toggle between zero and the last non-zero value
   anymore but simply between 0 and 1. For the former behaivour, one needs to use
   'cycle_value'.

 - Writing '%%' in the 'sprintf' format string now gives a literate '%', just
   as printf. Formely it stayed '%%'.
