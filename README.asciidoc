herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for X. It licensed under the
"Simplified BSD License" (see `LICENSE`).

- the layout is based on splitting frames into subframes which can be split
  again or can be filled with windows (similar to i3/ musca)

- tags (or workspaces or virtual desktops or â€¦) can be added/removed at
  runtime. Each tag contains an own layout

- exactly one tag is viewed on each monitor. The tags are monitor independent
  (similar to xmonad)

- it is configured at runtime via ipc calls from herbstclient. So the
  configuration file is just a script which is run on startup. (similar to
  wmii/musca)

For more, see the herbstluftwm homepage http://herbstluftwm.org -- in
particular the [herbstluftwm tutorial](http://herbstluftwm.org/tutorial.html)
for the first steps (also available as `man herbstluftwm-tutorial` after
installing herbstluftwm on your system).
