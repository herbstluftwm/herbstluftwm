herbstluftwm migration guide
============================

This guide describes the list of incompatible changes between the different
herbstluftwm releases and how to migrate scripts and configuration.
See the link:NEWS[] file for a list of all changes and new features.

0.9.4 to current git version
----------------------------
The command 'smart_frame_surroundings' is no longer a boolean, and as such it is
now incompatible with the 'toggle' command. Use 'cycle_values' instead:

    hc cycle_value settings.smart_frame_surroundings off hide_gaps hide_all

Instead of 'always_show_frame', the new 'show_frame_decorations' setting should
be used.

0.9.2 to 0.9.3
--------------
The command 'cycle_value' now expects an attribute path instead of a settings
name. For compatibility reasons, passing settings name directly (without the
prefix +settings.+) is still supported.

In ipc commands, herbstclient prints error messages always on stderr and normal
output always on stdout. Before, both were printed to the same channel,
either to stdout or stderr depending on the command's exit status. This
mainly affects combined commands.

In the rules, 'toggle' can not be used anymore in rule consequences. Moreover,
invalid arguments to rule consequences now will be reported during 'rule'
creation, already.

Only for people using the git-version: During the development of 0.9.3, the
'content_geometry' attribute of clients initially had the name
'geometry_reported'.

0.8.3 to 0.9.0
--------------

The tag_renamed hook has changed. The hook now emits *two* parameters.
The first parameter contains the old name of the tag
and the second parameter is the new name of the tag.

0.5.3 to 0.6.0
--------------
// Will be activated as soon as the patches are fixed and re-reverted
//The tag attributes curframe_windex and curframe_wcount have been removed, they
//are replaced by the more general attributes frames.focus.windex
//frames.focus.wcount.

The behaviour of swap_monitors_to_get_tag = 0 has changed. If
swap_monitors_to_get_tag is set to 0, then focus the other monitor if the
desired tag is shown on another monitor. Previously nothing has been done.

0.5.1 to 0.5.2
--------------
The herbstclient completion options changed for bash. If you manually setup the
completion -- e.g. for an alias like hc -- then update the complete line as
follows:

    complete -F _herbstclient_complete -o nospace herbstclient # or hc

0.4.1 to 0.5.0
--------------
herbstclient now returns the exitstatus 9 (HERBST_NEED_MORE_ARGS) instead of 3
(HERBST_INVALID_ARGUMENT) if a command needs more arguments. If an error occurs,
it now outputs an error message to stderr.

The padding arguments have been removed from add_monitor and a monitor name has
been added instead. If you add a monitor with padding, instead of 'hc
add_monitor 1024x768+0+0 1 2 3 4' now use 'hc add_monitor 1024x768+0+0; hc pad N
1 2 3 4'.

As a result from adding monitor names, the output of list_monitors and stack
changes a bit for named monitors. list_padding only outputs the padding for one
monitor now.

The setting focus_follows_shift has been removed. The behaviour now is set like
it were set to 1; the focus always follows the shift now.

0.3 to 0.4
----------
The setting window_gap is now called frame_gap. Simply replace all occurrences
of window_gap by frame_gap in your old scripts (and autostart).

0.2 to 0.3
----------
The setting ignore_class is removed, because this also can be done by rules. You
can replace a line like 'set ignore_class "$foo"' in your autostart by 'rule
class~"$foo" manage=off'

// vim: nowrap ft=asciidoc tw=80
