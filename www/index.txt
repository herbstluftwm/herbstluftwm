What is it?
-----------

herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for the X window system.

  * the entire configuration happens at runtime via the tool herbstclient. So
    the configuration file is just a script which is run on startup. All
    configuration options, window rules, virtual desktops, keybindings, ... can
    be updated live without the need to restart the window manager.

  * every virtual desktop (called 'tag') consists of a tiling and a floating
    layer. Windows in the tiling layer fill up the screen space and the
    floating windows can be placed freely above them.

  * both tiling and floating windows can be moved, resized, focused using
    the keyboard only.

  * the tiling algorithm is based on splitting frames into subframes which can be split
    again or can be filled with windows.

  * the screen space can be freely divided into "monitors" which may or may not
    match the actual (multi-)monitor hardware configuration. If you have a
    monitor with a large resolution just divide it into two or more virtual
    monitors such that you can view two virtual desktops at a time.

  * all monitors share the same pool of tags. You can switch the contents of
    two monitors with a single keystroke.
