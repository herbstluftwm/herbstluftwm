What is it?
-----------

herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for X11 using Xlib and Glib.
Its main features can be described with:

  * the layout is based on splitting frames into subframes which can be split
    again or can be filled with windows (similar to
    link:http://i3wm.org/[i3]/
    link:http://aerosuidae.net/musca.html[musca])

  * tags (or workspaces or virtual desktops or ...) can be added/removed at
    runtime. Each tag contains an own layout

  * exactly one tag is viewed on each monitor. The tags are monitor independent
    (similar to link:http://xmonad.org/[xmonad])

  * it is configured at runtime via ipc calls from herbstclient. So the
    configuration file is just a script which is run on startup. (similar to
