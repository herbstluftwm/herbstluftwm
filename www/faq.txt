Hints and FAQ
=============

Hint: Don't restart
-------------------
To make changes in your autostart take effect immediately, just type
+herbstclient reload+. There is no need to restart herbstluftwm or X. +

Even if you just updated you herbstluftwm-binary, there's no need to restart
anything. Run +herbstclient wmexec+, which does an +exec+(3) on the new
herbstluftwm version. (You also can use +wmexec+ to switch to another window
manager without restarting anything)

Hint: Use scripts!
------------------
There are a bunch of scripts coming along with herbstluftwm. Check out the
scripts directory in the sources and the examples directory after installing.

Hint: Understanding processes
-----------------------------
To understand the relationship between the different processes that running
in a typical herbstluftwm setup, consider the following diagram:

----
            startx
              | f/e
              V
         ~/.xinitrc
              | f/e or exec
IPC-Call         V
.- - - -> herbstluftwm           __________________
."            /     \             | Symbol | Meaning |
.            /       \            |--------+---------|
.       f/e /         \ f/e       |  A     | A forks |
.          /           \          |  | f/e | and     |
.         V             V         |  V     | execs   |
.     autostart       xterm       |  B     | into B  |
.         |             |         |________|_________|
.     f/e |             | f/e
.        V             V
-- herbstclient     $SHELL
----

As you can see, +herbstclient+ does nothing except sending requests to
+herbstluftwm+. Whenever a process performs a fork-and-exec, the following
rules apply:

        * A child process inherits the environment variables of its parent
          process. If you change an environment variable (like 'PATH'), then it
          will stay unchanged in the parent process. +
          +
          => If you want to set some environment variables for your complete
          session (i.e. all processes) then you have to set it in your
          +~/.xinitrc+.

        * If a process spawns a window, then the window will spawn delayed. This
          delay differs from application to application (and from time to time).
          So a script like

----
herbstclient spawn xterm
herbstclient spawn xev
----

does *not* guarantee that the +xterm+ window will appear before the
+xev+ window! It only guarantees that the +xterm+ is executed before +xev+ will
be executed.+

=> If you want to apply some rules only for the next windows, then use a
bash-script like the one for <<TEMP_RULES,temporary rules>>.


Q: Why is herbstluftwm called herbstluftwm?
-------------------------------------------
I liked the name of the e-mail client wanderlust. Unfortunately I am a happy
mutt user, so I needed an other application with a similar name.

[[FORK]]
Q: Is herbstluftwm a fork of dwm/musca/wmii/...?
------------------------------------------------
No. It was written from scratch, although it borrows some basic XLib function calls
(like updating numlock-state, sending a +WMDelete+-Message to a client,
updating the urgent hints, ...) from dwm.

Q: If the config is a bash script, does it mean it is called on each keystroke?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, the configuration file is executed once to set internal settings and
keybindings and so on. If a keybinding is registered and its key is pressed,
the according (internal) command directly is called.

Q: How can I let single clients float?
--------------------------------------
Not at all. You don't need it. You have the power of manual tiling, so
there is no need to place clients manually by dragging. Even better:
You don't even need to place them manually. Use a rule to place special
dialogs automatically when they appear. See the GIMP-Example for a good
example.

Q: But I use GIMP very often, how can I use it without floating?
----------------------------------------------------------------
Load a predefined layout to a gimp tag. Move the GIMP-Tool windows to the
left and right border and put the rest in the center. Add this to your
autostart:

----
# GIMP
# ensure there is a gimp tag
hc add gimp
hc load gimp '
(split horizontal:0.850000:0
(split horizontal:0.200000:1
(clients vertical:0)
(clients grid:0))
(clients vertical:0))
'               # load predefined layout
# center all other gimp windows on gimp tag
hc rule class=Gimp tag=gimp index=01 pseudotile=on
hc rule class=Gimp windowrole~'gimp-(image-window|toolbox|dock)' \
pseudotile=off
hc rule class=Gimp windowrole=gimp-toolbox focus=off index=00
hc rule class=Gimp windowrole=gimp-dock focus=off index=1
----

Q: What about an layout for Instant Messaging applications (Gajim, Pidgin, …)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A good layout for Instant Messaging applications where one frame on the left displays the roster, consuming ~15% of the monitor space, while the right side is used for the conversations can be configured easily with herbstluftwm. The following example configures such a layout on tag '7' and creates the rules to automatically move Gajim's windows to the right frame:

----
hc load 7 '(split horizontal:0.15:1 (clients horizontal:0) (clients grid:4))'
hc rule class="Gajim" tag=7 index=1
hc rule class="Gajim" windowrole="roster" tag=7 index=0
----

For pidgin, the setup looks similar. In this case the buddy list is on the
right with a width of 20% of the monitor space. In addition to the above, the
buddy list will not receive input focus when it shows up:
----
imtag=7 # just set the name of the tag here
hc load "$imtag" '(split horizontal:0.800000:0 (clients grid:0) (clients vertical:0))'
hc rule class=Pidgin   windowrole=buddy_list tag=$imtag index=1 focus=off
hc rule class=Pidgin ! windowrole=buddy_list tag=$imtag index=0
----


[[TEMP_RULES]]
Q: How can I add rules temporarily for some special clients?
------------------------------------------------------------
Add a rule for the clients pid, before the client appears. This script
creates two xterms with different behaviours:

----
#!/bin/bash

# Requirement: bash >= 4.0 (because of the usage of $BASHPID)

spawn_with_rules() {(
    # this rule also requires, that the client
    # sets the _NET_WM_PID property
    herbstclient rule once pid=$BASHPID maxage=10 "${RULES[@]}"
    exec "$@"
    ) &
}

# spawn an xterm with uname info, but not where the focus is
RULES=( index='/' focus=off )
spawn_with_rules xterm -e 'uname -a ; read'

# spawn an xterm in pseudotile mode
RULES=( pseudotile=on focus=on )
spawn_with_rules xterm
----

Q: Why doesn't a new client receive focus?
------------------------------------------
The reason is the default setting of the +focus+ consequence in the rules.
You can change it by adding this to the link:herbstluftwm.html#RULES[rules]
section in the autostart file:

----
hc unrule --all      # clear rules
hc rule focus=on     # focus new clients by default
----

Warning: you need the current git version to get rules!

Q: herbstclient is too long to type it in the shell
---------------------------------------------------
Use tab-completion! +her&lt;tab&gt;c&lt;tab&gt;+ expands to herbstclient.
There is also a tab-completion for the herbstclient parameters. After
installing herbstluftwm, add this to your .bashrc:

----
source /etc/bash_completion.d/herbstclient-completion
----

(The tab-completion in zsh works out of the box with most zsh-configurations).

You also can add an alias for herbstclient:

----
alias hc='herbstclient'
----

Q: My rules seem to be messed up
--------------------------------
Clear them with +hc unrule -F+ and start over. It is recommended to do this
in the autostart file.

Q: I don't like that my mplayervideo/inputdialogs get resized to full framesize
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add this to your autostartfile:

----
hc rule instance=<instance> pseudotile=on
----

You can request the instancename with xprop by clicking on the related window.
+<instancename>+ is the first string in the line +WM_CLASS(STRING)+ (for
mplayer that would be +xv+, for firefox dialogs it is +Dialog+).

Q: I set default_frame_layout to my favorite layout but it doesn't work with the root frame/existing frames
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Existing tags are not affected by a change of that variable (only new
ones), so be sure to set it *before* creating any tags. A current
workaround is to put +hc split vertical 0.5; hc remove+ at the end in your
autostart file.  You can also 'cycle_layout' in existing tags.

[[PANELS]]
Q: How can I start external panels correctly?
---------------------------------------------
The cleanest solution to start the external EWMH panel (like +xfce4-panel+)
from the autostart and manually reserve some space for it. Also start
+herbstclient+ instance that knows when to kill the panel again so that
there aren't multiple instances when reloading the autostart multiple
times. Append the following code to your +bash+ autostart (assuming the
panel needs 31 pixels at the bottom of monitor 0):

----
# add an external panel
{
    pids=( )
    # reserve some space for the panel on monitor 0
    hc pad 0 "" "" 31
    # start the panel itself and remember its pid
    xfce4-panel -d --sm-client-disable &
    pids+=( $! )
    # or start another panel:
    # mypanel &
    # pids+=( $! )
    # wait until the panels should be stopped
    herbstclient -w '(quit_panel|reload)'
    # stopp all started panels
    kill ${pids[@]}
} &
----

Q: I'm using a compositing manager like xcompmgr and get ugly artifacts when switching tags or splitting frames
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You probably have an old version of herbstluftwm and +frame_bg_transparent+
enabled. Disable this setting and use +frame_active_opacity+ and/or
+frame_normal_opacity+ instead or upgrade to the current git version.
