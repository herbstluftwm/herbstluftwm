HACKING
=======

If you want to contribute to herbstluftwm, this file is for you!

Testing herbstluftwm
--------------------
You can test herbstluftwm under any window manager. Install Xephyr and valgrind,
and make sure you have herbstluftwm compiled. Then run the script:

    ./valigrind-xephyr.sh

It creates a Xephyr window in which herbstluftwm runs using the default
autostart. Any crashes or memory leaks are reported in detail by valgrind. Quit
herbstluftwm (Alt-Shift-q or run herbstclient quit) to end testing.

Contributing
------------
Beside writing code you can help herbstluftwm by testing, reporting bugs,
writing/fixing documentation (e.g. by fixing spelling mistakes) or packaging it
for distributions.

Build system
------------
The build system mainly is one Makefile. To check which source files depend on
which header files it uses dependency files src/*.d and ipc-client/*.d (one for
each C source file) which are generated by default.

Note: If you switch a branch, the dependency files are not marked as dirty!
This may cause unresolvable dependencies e.g. if you switch from a branch with
a new header file to a branch without it. So after switching the branch, you
always should remove dependency files by running:

    make cleandeps

Running tests
-------------

Tests are run using pytest[1] and tox[2]. With tox and Xvfb[3] installed, you
can simply run `tox` to run the testsuite.

[2] https://tox.readthedocs.io/

Sending patches
---------------
You can use git to make commits and create patches from them via the command
git format-patch. Always specify your full name and a valid e-mail address in
the author field. The commit description must consist two parts, separated by
an empty line:

  - A mandatory short description in imperative form, e.g.: "Do things in this
    or that way". The description must not exceed 50 characters.
  - An optional longer description consisting of full sentences. This is only
    needed if the commit introduces non-trivial changes.

When introducing new features, always

  - add documentation for it in doc/herbstluftwm.txt (or doc/herbstclient.txt).
  - document the change (e.g. "new command ...") in the NEWS file.

You can send those patches to the mailing list[1] or via the irc[2].

[1] hlwm@lists.herbstluftwm.org +
[2] #herbstluftwm on irc.freenode.net

Mailing list
------------
The main mailing list for general development, discussion, release
announcements is:

    hlwm@lists.herbstluftwm.org

You can subscribe by sending a mail with subscribe in the subject to

    hlwm-request@lists.herbstluftwm.org

or by using the web interface at:

    https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/hlwm


Coding style
------------
The coding style is similar to the Linux-kernel style with some changes:

  - Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.
  - Do not add any trailing spaces at the end of a line.
  - Data type names are CamelCase
  - Globals must be prefixed with g_
  - If a function returns success or failure, then encode it in a bool (from
    stdbool.h). Use main()-like exit codes (0 = success, non zero =
    failure) only for commands.


Internal structure
------------------
The main modules (i.e. source file + header file) communicate like this if a
key is pressed or if a command is called via herbstclient:

                 X11
                  |
                  V
              +--------+  key  +-----+ call  +---------+
              |  main  |------>| key |------>| command |
              +--------+ event +-----+       +---------+
                  \                    output /  ^
           IPC-Call\      +------------+<----'  / Execute
            -Window `---->| ipc-server |-------'  IPC-Call
              -Event      +------------+
                                 |
                                 V
                                X11

herbstclient is rather simple:

                 Command-Line-   +------+
                   Arguments --->| main |----.
                                 |      |   X11
                    stdout  <----|      |<---'
                                 +------+

// vim: nowrap ft=asciidoc tw=80
