HACKING
=======

If you want to contribute to herbstluftwm, this file is for you!

Contributing
------------
Beside writing code you can help herbstluftwm by testing, reporting bugs,
writing/fixing documentation (e.g. by fixing spelling mistakes) or packaging it
for distributions.

Testing herbstluftwm
--------------------
You can test herbstluftwm under any window manager. Install Xephyr and valgrind,
and make sure you have herbstluftwm compiled. Then run the following:

    # create a build directory
    mkdir debug && cd debug
    # in the build directory, compile it:
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    make
    # run herbstluftwm within a xeyphyr session:
    ../valgrind-xephyr.sh

It creates a Xephyr window in which herbstluftwm runs using the default
autostart. Any crashes or memory leaks are reported in detail by valgrind. Quit
herbstluftwm (Alt-Shift-q or run herbstclient quit) to end testing.

Running tests
-------------

Tests are run using pytest[1] and tox[2]. In addition to tox,
you'll have to install additional dependencies, in order to successfully
run the complete test suite:

  - xvfb[3]
  - xdotool
  - xsetroot
  - xterm

With everything installed, you can run the following from the build directory:

    tox -c ..  -- -v --maxfail=1

Depending on the Python 3 version you have installed, e.g. 3.9.x, it may be
necessary to add -e py39 to the tox parameters (that is, before the --). If you
have an old version of tox installed, it may be necessary to pass ../tox.ini
instead of .. to the -c parameter.

The argument after the -- are pytest parameters (add -h to see a help). If you
do not want to use tox and instead run pytest directly, then call the following
command in the build directory:

    python3 -m pytest ../tests

Sending patches
---------------
You can hand in pull requests on github[1], but also send patches directly
(obtained by git format-patch). You can send those patches to the mailing
list[2] or via the irc[3].

Mailing list
------------
The main mailing list for general development, discussion, release
announcements is:

    hlwm@lists.herbstluftwm.org

You can subscribe by sending a mail with subscribe in the subject to

    hlwm-request@lists.herbstluftwm.org

or by using the web interface at:

    https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/hlwm


Coding style
------------
The coding style is mainly Qt's C++ coding style.

  - Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.
  - Do not add any trailing spaces at the end of a line.
  - Data type names are CamelCase
  - If a function returns success or failure, then encode it in a bool. Use
    main()-like exit codes (0 = success, non zero = failure) only for commands.
  - Order includes according to the Google C++ Style Guide:
    https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Names_and_Order_of_Includes
    (Note that for the purposes of this rule, all <â€¦> headers are system headers)
