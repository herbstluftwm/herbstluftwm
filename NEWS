herbstluftwm NEWS -- History of user-visible changes
----------------------------------------------------

See the link:MIGRATION[] file for changes that introduced incompatibility to
older versions.

Current git version
-------------------

  * New autostart object with attributes 'path', 'running', 'pid', 'last_status'
  * New client attribute 'floating_effectively' and associated X11 properties
    'HLWM_FLOATING_WINDOW' and 'HLWM_TILING_WINDOW'
  * New read-only client attribute 'decoration_geometry'.
  * Bug fixes:
    - Update floating geometry if a client's size hints change

Release 0.9.3 on 2021-05-15
---------------------------

  * herbstclient prints error messages always on stderr and normal output
    always on stdout (before, both were printed to the same channel).
  * True transparency support for frame and client decorations (requires a
    compositor like picom, compton, or xcompmgr)
  * Colors contain alpha-values (format #RRGGBBAA)
  * Do not draw frame background behind clients (so for semi-transparent
    client decorations, one does not see the frame decoration behind but the
    wallpaper instead)
  * New command line option '--replace' for replacing an existing window manager.
  * New command 'list_clients'.
  * The frame attributes ('selection', 'algorithm', 'fraction', 'split_type')
    are now writable.
  * New objects for panels (under 'panels', exposing attributes 'instance',
    'class', 'geometry', 'winid')
  * The setting 'monitors_locked' is now explicitly an unsigned integer.
  * The setting 'default_frame_layout' now holds an algorithm name.
  * New client attributes:
    - 'floating_geometry' holding the client's floating size (writable).
    - 'content_geometry' holding the geometry of the application's content.
  * The 'shift' command now moves the window to a neighboured monitor if
    the window cannot be moved within a tag in the desired direction.
  * New command 'lower' to lower a window in the stack.
  * The 'cycle_value' command now expects an attribute (and only works for
    settings for compatibility).
  * New object 'types' containing documentation on (attribute-) types.
  * New command 'attr_type' printing the type of a given attribute.
  * New client alias 'last-minimized' and 'longest-minimized' for focusing
    and unminimizing minimized clients.
  * Relative values for integer attributes ('+=N' and '-=N')
  * The 'cycle' command now also cycles through floating windows.
  * The 'rule' command now reports errors already during rule creation.
  * In rule consequences, 'toggle' is not allowed anymore.
  * New rule consequences:
    - 'floating_geometry' for setting the attribute of the same name (i.e.
      position and size of the new client)
  * The python bindings automatically convert from and to python's types
  * Bug fixes:
    - Fix mistakenly transparent borders of argb clients
  * New dependency: xrender

Release 0.9.2 on 2021-02-17
---------------------------

  * Client window titles (controlled by the theme attributes 'title_height',
    'title_color', 'title_font')
  * New command 'help' for live documentation on the object tree
  * New 'watch' command that emits hooks when attribute values change.
  * The 'lock_tag' attribute is now writable.
  * New 'geometry' attribute for monitors.
  * Bug fixes:
    - Correctly interpret _NET_WM_STRUT. This fixes panels that leave a bit of
      space between the panel and the monitor edge and also panels between two
      monitors.
    - Correctly handling minimized clients when removing a tag.
    - Preserve stacking order when changing the floating state of a tag
    - Update frame objects correctly in the commands 'mirror' and 'rotate'
  * New dependencies: xft, freetype

Release 0.9.1 on 2020-12-28
---------------------------

  * Client minimization (controlled by the attribute 'minimized' of every client)
  * The 'index' attribute of tags is now writable. This allows adjusting the
    order of existing tags.
  * New child object 'focused_client' for each tag object.
  * New child object 'focused_frame' for the tiling object of each tag object.
  * New child object 'parent_frame' for each client providing the frame the client sits in
  * New command 'mirror'
  * New command 'apply_tmp_rule'
  * The 'apply_rules' command now reports parse errors
  * Reserve space for panels that do not set _NET_WM_STRUT e.g. conky windows
    of type 'dock'.
  * Only build json object doc if WITH_DOCUMENTATION is activated
  * Bug fixes:
    - When hiding windows, correctly set their WM_STATE to IconicState (we set
      it to Withdrawn state before, which means "unmanaged" and thus is wrong).
      This may require restarting pagers when upgrading hlwm live.
    - Fix crash in 'split explode'
    - 'split explode' preserves the window focus (as in v0.7.2 and before)

Release 0.9.0 on 2020-10-31
---------------------------

  * When an application fails to focus itself (because
    focus_stealing_prevention is active), then the window is marked as urgent.
  * New optional argument for the 'split' command for splitting non-leaf frames
  * Frame objects: the frame layout can be introspected via the 'tiling' object
    present in each tag, e.g.: 'tags.focus.tiling'.
  * New command 'foreach' for iterating over objects
  * New attribute 'urgent_count' for tags, counting the number of urgent clients on a tag
  * New rule consequence 'floatplacement' that updates the placement of floating
    clients ('floatplacement=smart' for little overlap,
    'floatplacement=center' for centering) or leaves the floating position as
    is ('floatplacement=none')
  * New rule condition 'pgid'
  * New format specifier '%c' in the 'sprintf' command (useful in combination with 'foreach')
  * The 'new_attr' command now also accepts an initial value
  * React to a change of the 'floating_focused' attribute of the tag object
  * New frame index character 'p' for accessing the parent frame
  * Object tree documentation as a json file
  * Bug fixes:
    - Fix wrong behaviour in 'cycle_layout' in the case where the current layout
      is not contained in the layout list passed to 'cycle_layout'.
    - Fix handling of delta -1 in 'focus_monitor' and 'cycle_monitor'
    - Fixed precision decimals in the layout tree (more reliable in- and output
      of fractions in frame splits)
    - Fixes in maximize.sh


Release 0.8.3 on 2020-06-06
---------------------------

  * Bug fixes:
    - Fix race condition in focus_follows_mouse handling

Release 0.8.2 on 2020-05-04
---------------------------

  * Selection of empty frames by the mouse (by click or by hover if
    focus_follows_mouse is enabled)
  * The commands 'close_and_remove' / 'close_or_remove' act like 'close' for
    floating clients
  * The decoration window allows focusing, moving, and resizing the client
    via the mouse (as known from standard floating window managers)
  * Improved herbstclient tab completion for the fish shell
  * Bug fixes:
    - Fix a crash in the error handler when a invalid monitor name is
      passed. (Affects list_padding move_monitor rename_monitor lock_tag
      unlock_tag)
    - Fix the type of WM_STATE
    - The client attributes sizehints_tiling and sizehints_floating are now
      writable
    - Fix EWMH urgency change for clients without WM hints set
    - Fix the exit code of the 'focus' command

Release 0.8.1 on 2020-04-21
---------------------------

  * the frame index 'e' refers to the first empty frame (e.g. 'rule index=e' places
    new windows in empty frames, if possible)
  * new setting 'hide_covered_windows' to improve the appearance when used with
    a compositor.
  * resize floating windows with the same command ('resize') as in tiling mode
    and thus the same keybindings as in tiling mode. Therefore, the
    'fractiondelta' parameter to the 'resize' command is now optional.
  * keybind now checks that the bound command exists.
  * cycle_all (Alt-Tab) now also traverses floating clients
  * new setting 'auto_detect_panels' controlling the panel detection algorithm.
  * improved herbstclient tab completion for the fish shell
  * Bug fixes:
    - Handle the regular expression "" correctly, since the grammar of extended
      regular expressions does not allow "".
    - Error handling for the lack of xrandr
    - Fixes to make it compile on other systems and architecture

Release 0.8.0 on 2020-04-09
---------------------------

  * single window floating (every client has an attribute 'floating' which can
    be set at run time and via the rule consequence 'floating=on')
  * monitor detection via xrandr
  * detection of external panels
  * new command: apply_rules
  * new command: export (convenience wrapper around setenv)
  * new client attribute: keys_inactive (negation of keymask)
  * new command: drag (initiates moving/resizing a window by mouse)
  * if tags have been configured through EWMH before herbstluftwm starts (from
    a previous running window manager), then herbstluftwm re-uses these tags
    (start with --no-tag-import to disable this)
  * The build system is now cmake. See the INSTALL file if you need to
    compile herbstluftwm yourself.
  * the 'remove' command now tries to preserve the focus and the client
    arrangement. Intuitively speaking, 'remove' is undoing a frame split.
  * Many boolean style settings were formerly of type int. Now, these are
    boolean settings.
  * The 'toggle' command only works for boolean settings. For the former
    behavior for int-typed settings, use 'cycle_value'.
  * Writing '%%' in the 'sprintf' format string now gives a literate '%', just
    as printf. Formerly it stayed '%%'.
  * The 'keybind' command now accepts all valid key symbols, even if they are
    not present on the current keyboard layout at the time of setup.
  * the rules are also applied to those clients that change their WM_CLASS
    after being shown already.
  * 'detect_monitors' has an additional '--list-all' parameter
  * do not change the focus (for focus_follows_mouse=1) when an unmanaged
    dialog (e.g. a rofi menu or a notification) closes.
  * list_rules now prints regex-based rule conditions with '~' instead of '='
  * new attributes on every monitor for pad_up pad_down pad_left pad_right
  * new flag --exit-on-xerror (to be used in automated testing only)
  * Formerly, double dots in object paths were allowed (similar to double
    slashes in file paths in unix). Right now, they are only allowed at the end
    (which is necessary for the tab-completion of attr):
    - +monitors+ is valid
    - +monitors.+ is valid
    - +monitors..+ is valid
    - +monitors.by-name.+ is valid
    - +monitors..by-name.+ is *invalid*

Release 0.7.2 on 2019-05-28
---------------------------

   * When herbstluftwm is not running and herbstclient is called, the
     absent herbstluftwm is detected instead of hanging forever.
   * Close window on _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW. This makes closing windows via ewmh
     panels work.
   * Fix return code of remove_attr
   * Fix error when unmanaging clients
   * Some typo fixes in the documentation

Release 0.7.1 on 2018-08-09
---------------------------

    * Many bugfixes:
      - Fix Xlib race condition
      - Fix _NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT
      - etc
    * New setting: verbose
    * Fix the initial floating position of new windows by taking their
      position relative to the nearest hlwm monitor.
    * new example scripts:

      - float-maximize.sh

Release 0.7.0 on 2016-02-04
---------------------------

    * Handle EWMH request _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE more conform
    * Make tag objects accessible by their index
    * Automatically unmanage desktop windows (e.g. xfdesktop), and force them
      to stay below all other windows.
    * new command: close_and_remove
    * new herbstclient flags: --last-arg --print0
    * new example scripts:

      - maximize.sh
      - toggledualhead.sh
      - windowmenu.sh
      - wselect.sh (new subcommand "select_here")

Release 0.6.2 on 2014-03-27
---------------------------
Two bug fixes:

    * A crash has been fixed. It could be triggered by changing a
      non-callback settings attribute e.g. settings.raise_on_focus
    * The dialog re-mapping-problem has been fixed. So now, applications can
      show the same dialogs again after the dialog has been closed (e.g. the
      connection window of qjackctl).


Release 0.6.1 on 2014-03-25
---------------------------

    * directional shift of floating windows
    * fix crash of directional focus
    * document theme.minimal

Release 0.6.0 on 2014-03-19
---------------------------

    * Add window decorations, configurable via the theme-object
    * The tag attributes curframe_windex and curframe_wcount have been removed,
      they are replaced by the more general attributes frames.focus.windex
      frames.focus.wcount.
    * new example script: scratchpad.sh
    * if swap_monitors_to_get_tag is set to 0, then focus the other monitor if
      the desired tag is shown on another monitor instead of doing nothing
    * new split mode: auto
    * new attribute monitors.count indicating the number of monitors
    * new settings object with an attribute for each setting.
    * directional focus for floating clients, i.e. switch between floating
      windows via focus left|right|up|down. It also raises the freshly focused
      window.
    * directional monitor focusing
    * new detect_monitors flags: --list -l --no-disjoin while detect_monitors
      does disjoin_rects on the detected monitors per default.
    * For each client a keymask can be given. A keymask is a regular
      expression, that is matched against the string representation of a
      keybinding. If it matches, the keybinding is enabled for this client,
      otherwise not. The default is an empty keymask ("") that matches all
      keybindings, so no bindings are masked out by default. A keymask is a
      client attribute, and can be set by a client rule.
    * add completion to the mousebind command
    * add mouse function call to call commands on mouse button press
    * add setting update_dragged_clients
    * new rule consequence: monitor
    * new command: try
    * new command: silent

Release 0.5.3 on 2013-12-24
---------------------------

    * make window floating faster, by dropping old motion events
    * new rule flag: prepend
    * close now accepts an arbitrary window id as a parameter
    * Also allow decimal window ids for commands accepting a window id, like
      raise, jump, close
    * new split modes, i.e. parameters to the split command: bottom, right
      (indicating the relative location of the new empty frame)
    * new split mode: explode
    * make fraction parameter for the split command optional
    * respect size hints in floating and tiling mode
    * new setting: frame_transparent_width
    * frame_bg_transparent: instead of copying the pixmap from the root window
      achieve transparency by cutting out a rectangle from the center of frames
      using the Shape Extension of X.
    * Make respecting of sizehints configurable for tiling and floating mode
      via the client properties sizehints_tiling and sizehints_floating
    * new setting: pseudotile_center_threshold
    * new command: cycle_frame
    * new object attribute type: color

Release 0.5.2 on 2013-06-23
---------------------------

Changes:

    * cycle_all now raises the focused client.
    * focus a client on its tag after moving it there (by shift_to_monitor or move)
    * disallow focus_follows_mouse if the focus change hides another window
      (e.g. an pseudotiled window in the max layout). In that case an extra
      click is required to change the focus.
    * new command complete_shell for posix shell specific completion
    * add completion for the rule command
    * add completion for keycombinations in keybind
    * add completion for setenv, getenv and unsetenv
    * the hook consequence now also tells the window id that triggerd the rule
    * new command: echo
    * new commands: true false
    * rule labels: rules can be given a label with the 'label' property. The
      label can be printed to stdout using the 'printlabel' flag to the rule
      command. Unrule command accepts a label to remove all rules with that
      label.
    * new command: list_rules
    * allow true/false as arguments to commands accepting boolean values. This
      affects the commands: floating, fullscreen, pseudotile and rule.
    * new command: new_attr, remove_attr, get_attr, set_attr
    * new command: substitute, sprintf, mktemp

Release 0.5.1 on 2013-01-05
---------------------------

Changes:

    * new command: use_previous
    * Makefile: new target: install-nodoc -- install without man/html-docs
    * fixup of the + flag in tag_status
    * fixup of the example script q3terminal.sh
    * announce it if the tag changes due to remove_monitor

Release 0.5.0 on 2012-12-31
---------------------------
Incompatible changes:

    * The setting focus_follows_shift has been removed. The behaviour now is
      set like it were set to 1; the focus always follows the shift now.

Changes:

    * new settings: wmname, mouse_recenter_gap
    * hook togglehidepanel: the default panel.sh also accepts the parameters
      "current" or a certain monitor index
    * align captions of the tree output (commands: layout, stack) better by
      inserting a space in front of every caption
    * let new clients and monitors (and other items that are stacked) appear on
      top of the stacking order
    * chaining of commands now is possible with the new command: chain
    * new commands: and or negate
    * tag switch locking for monitors. The new lock_tag and unlock_tag commands
      control, whether tag switching operations for a monitor are allowed.
    * set the urgent flag on _NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION
    * clear the urgent flag on window focus
    * new command: list_padding
    * new commands: getenv/setenv/unsetenv
    * new rule: ewmhnotify
    * floating, fullscreen, pseudotile: default to toggle if no argument is
      given
    * add error messages for herbstclient
    * new commands: focus_edge, shift_edge
    * new command: shift_to_monitor
    * optional names for monitors, new command rename_monitor
    * new consequence: hook
    * new example script: q3terminal.sh which provides a q3-like terminal

Release: 0.4.1 on 2012-08-30
----------------------------

This fixes some build system issues:

    * Separate CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS
    * Add patch level to the version number
    * Only use __MACH__ if really needed
    * Honor CPPFLAGS

Release: 0.4 on 2012-08-18
--------------------------

Changes that require user interaction on upgrade:

    * the setting window_gap is now called frame_gap

Other changes:

    * new setting window_gap which controls the gap between windows within one
      frame

    * new settings: window_border_inner_color and window_border_inner_width
    * new settings: frame_border_inner_color and frame_border_inner_width
    * new option --skip-invisible for cycle_all
    * cycle_layout now offers to cycle through a custom list of layouts
    * add completion for +1 and -1 to many commands: cycle, cycle_all,
      cycle_monitor, cycle_layout, split and use_index
    * start system wide autostart file if there is no working user defined one
    * clients are restored (i.e. managed) from _NET_CLIENT_LIST even if they
      are not visible
    * do proper window and monitor stacking, this also introduces:

      - new command: raise_monitor
      - new setting: raise_on_focus_temporarily
      - new command: stack

    * new command: bring
    * respect the WM_TAKE_FOCUS atom, this fixes keyboard focus issues with
      many (mostly Java/swing based) applications
    * new rule consequences: switchtag, ewmhrequests

Release 0.3 on 2012-04-12
-------------------------

Changes:

    * new hook: window_title_changed
    * hook focus_changed now also reports the window title
    * the setting ignore_class is removed, because this also can be done by
      rules. You can replace a line like 'set ignore_class "$foo"' in your

    * respect the initial fullscreen state of new clients on startup (as it is
      set in the _NET_WM_STATE property)
    * monitor locking mechanism, i.e. a new setting: monitors_locked with its
      accessors lock and unlock and the command line argument -l and --locked

planned features). Currently implemented features are:

    * basic tiling concept
    * floating mode (with border snapping)
    * calling herbstluftwm internal commands with herbstclient
    * change keybindings/mousebindings at runtime
    * change/get settings (e.g. colors) at runtime

    * dump/load tiling layouts to/from a string
    * bash/zsh tab completion for herbstclient
    * hook system: let herbstclient listen for internal events
    * provide an easy way to build an own panel (using herbstclient hooks/commands)
      (there is also an example panel.sh)
    * give information about urgent state of clients

// vim: ft=asciidoc
