Release 0.1 on 2011-10-02
-------------------------

Initial release. The tiling algorithm and many things are working. But some
things like EWMH or rules aren't implemented yet (See BUGS file for a list of
planned features). Currently implemented features are:

    * basic tiling concept
    * floating mode (with border snapping)
    * calling herbstluftwm internal commands with herbstclient
    * change keybindings/mousebindings at runtime
    * change/get settings (e.g. colors) at runtime
    * add/remove monitors at runtime
    * wmexec into other window manager
    * dump/load tiling layouts to/from a string
    * bash/zsh tab completion for herbstclient
    * hook system: let herbstclient listen for internal events
    * provide an easy way to build an own panel (using herbstclient hooks/commands)
      (there is also an example panel.sh)
    * give information about urgent state of clients
