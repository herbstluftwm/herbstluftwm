herbstluftwm-tutorial - A tutorial introduction to herbstluftwm

Description
-----------
This tutorial explains how to create a basic herbstluftwm setup and introduces
the major herbstluftwm features. This tutorial neither covers all features nor
specifies the mentioned features entirely; see
link:herbstluftwm.html[*herbstluftwm*(1)] for a compact and more complete
description.

This tutorial covers these topics:

  - <<installation,Basic installation>>
  - <<client,Usage of the client>>
  - <<tiling,The tiling method>>
  - <<tags,Tags (or workspaces...)>>
  - <<monitors,Multi-Monitor handling>>

[[installation]]
Basic installation
------------------
This describes two alternate installation methods. In any case, you also have to
install the dependencies. Beside the standard libraries (XLib) which are
found on nearly any system, you should install dzen2 (as current as possible)
which is needed by the default +panel.sh+.

Via the package manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You always should prefer installing herbstluftwm via your package manager on your
system. It should be called +herbstluftwm+.

After installing it, the default configuration file has to be copied to your
home directory:

----
mkdir -p ~/.config/herbstluftwm
cp /etc/xdg/herbstluftwm/autostart ~/.config/herbstluftwm/
----

You also should activate the tab completion for +herbstclient+. In case of
bash, you can either activate the tab completion in general or source the
herbstclient-completion from the bash_completion.d directory in your bashrc. In
case of zsh the tab-completion normally is activated already (if not, consider
activating it).

Directly from git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there is no package for your platform or if you want to use the current git
version, then you can pull directly from the main repository:

----
git clone https://github.com/herbstluftwm/herbstluftwm
cd herbstluftwm
make # build the binaries

# install files
mkdir -p ~/bin
# you also have to put $HOME/bin to your path, e.g. by:
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc # or to your zshrc, etc...
ln -s `pwd`/herbstluftwm ~/bin/
ln -s `pwd`/herbstclient ~/bin/

# copy the configuration
mkdir -p ~/.config/herbstluftwm/
cp share/autostart ~/.config/herbstluftwm/
cp share/panel.sh ~/.config/herbstluftwm/
----

  - If you are using bash, then source the bash completion file in your +~/.bashrc+
+
----
source path-to/herbstluftwm/share/herbstclient-completion
----

  - If you are using zsh, then copy the +share/_herbstclient+ file to the
    appropriate zsh-completion directory.

Each time there is an update, you have to do the following steps in your
herbstluftwm directory:

----
git pull
make
----

Configure herbstluftwm as your window manager
---------------------------------------------

As usual you can define herbstluftwm as your window manager by either selecting
herbstluftwm in your login manager or by starting it in your +~/.xinitrc+,
mostly by writing to your xinitrc (or +.xsession+ on some systems):

----
exec herbstluftwm
----

After logging in the next time, you will get a default herbstluftwm session.

First start
-----------
After starting herbstluftwm, the screen is surrounded by a green frame initially,
which indicates that there is only one large frame. A frame is a container
where actual windows can be placed or which can be split into two
frames.

Start an +xterm+ by pressing Alt-Return, which will fill your entire screen.

[[client]]
Using the client
----------------
The only way to communicate to herbstluftwm is by using the client application
called link:herbstclient.html[+herbstclient+]. Its usual syntax is:
+herbstclient COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]+. This calls a certain +COMMAND+ within your
running herbstluftwm instance. This causes some effect (which depends on the
given +COMMAND+ and +ARGUMENTS+), produces some output which is printed by
+herbstclient+ and lets +herbstclient+ exit with a exit-code (e.g. 0 for
success) like many other UNIX tools:

----
    shell              COMMANDS,
       ╲ COMMAND,      ARGUMENTS
        ╲ ARGUMENTS ╭────────────╮
         ╲          │            │
          V         │            V
         herbstclient         herbstluftwm
          ╱         ^            │
         ╱ output,  │            │
        ╱ exit-code ╰────────────╯
       V               output,
 shell/terminal       exit-code
----

The most simple command only prints the herbstluftwm version:

----
$ # lines prefixed with $ describes what to type, other lines describe the
$ # typical output
$ # Type: her<tab>c<tab> ve<tab>
$ herbstclient version
herbstluftwm 0.4.1 (built on Aug 30 2012)
$ herbstclient set window_border_active_color red
$ # now the window border turned red
----

The configuration of herbstluftwm only is done by calling commands via
herbstclient. So the only configuration file is the +autostart+ which is placed
at +~/.config/herbstluftwm/+ and which is a sequence of those herbstclient
calls.

Open it in your favourite text editor and replace the Mod-line by this to use
the Super-key (or also called Windows-key) as the main modifier:

----
# Mod=Mod1 # use alt as the main modifier
Mod=Mod4 # use Super as the main modifier
----

After saving the autostart file, you have to reload the configuration:

----
# the following line is identical to directly calling:
# ~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart
herbstclient reload
----

Now you may notice that the red border color of your terminal turned green
again, because the color is set in the default autostart. That's the typical
configuration workflow:

  . Try some new settings in the command line
  . Add them to the autostart file
  . Press Mod-Shift-r which calls the +reload+ command or directly execute the
    autostart file from your shell to get the error messages if something went
    wrong.

To learn more about herbstluftwm, just go through the man page line by
line and check using the link:herbstluftwm.html[herbstluftwm(1) man page] what
it does. For a quick introduction to the central paradigms, continue reading
this.

[[tiling]]
Tiling
------
Initially there is one frame. Each frame has one of the two following possible
types:

  . It serves as a container for windows, i.e. it can hold zero up to
  arbitrarily many windows. Launch several more terminals to see what happens:
  If there are multiple windows in one frame, they are aligned below each other.
  To change this layout algorithm, press Mod-space to cycle all the available
  layouting algorithms for the focused frame.

  . A frame also can be split into two subframes, which can be aligned next to
  or below each other. Press Mod-o to split to an horizontal alignment. To
  navigate to the fresh frame right of the old one press Mod-l. Press Mod-u to
  split vertically. The intuitive navigation is: +
+
----
      ⎧ h (or ←) ⎫                 ⎧ left
      ⎪ j (or ↓) ⎪   means         ⎪ down
Mod + ⎨ k (or ↑) ⎬  ═══════> focus ⎨ up
      ⎩ l (or →) ⎭                 ⎩ right
----
+
To undo splitting, you can remove a frame via Mod-r. To shift some window from
one frame to one of its neighbours, use the same keyboard shortcut while holding
the Shift key pressed. It is not possible to resize single windows, only to
resize frames. The according keyboard shortcut is the same while holding Control
pressed. All in all it is:
+
----
                    ⎧ h (or ←) ⎫                          ⎧ left
      ⎧         ⎫   ⎪ j (or ↓) ⎪  means  ⎧ focus frame  ⎫ ⎪ down
Mod + ⎨ Shift   ⎬ + ⎨ k (or ↑) ⎬  ═════> ⎨ move window  ⎬ ⎨ up
      ⎩ Control ⎭   ⎩ l (or →) ⎭         ⎩ resize frame ⎭ ⎩ right
----

With this, you can define a custom layout. It can be printed via the +layout+
command:

----
$ herbstclient layout
╾─┐ horizontal 50% selection=1
  ├─┐ vertical 70% selection=0
  │ ├─╼ vertical: 0x1400009
  │ └─╼ vertical:
  └─╼ max: 0x1a00009 [FOCUS]
----

Just play with it a bit to understand how it works. You also can permanently save the
layout using the +dump+ command:

----
$ herbstclient dump
(split horizontal:0.500000:1
    (split vertical:0.700000:0
        (clients vertical:0 0x1400009)
        (clients vertical:0))
    (clients max:0 0x1a00009))
$ layout=$(herbstclient dump)
----

And after some changes you can rewind to the original layout with the +load+
command:

----
$ herbstclient load "$layout"       # mind the quotes!
----

[[tags]]
Tags (or workspaces or virtual desktops or ....)
------------------------------------------------
A tag consists of a name and a frame layout with clients on it. With the default
autostart, there are nine tags named 1 to 9. You can switch to the ith tag using
Mod-i, e.g. Mod-4 to switch to tag 4 or with the command +use 4+. A window can
be move to tag i via Mod-Shift-i, i.e. with the +move+ command.

[[monitors]]
Monitors
--------
The notion of a monitor in herbstluftwm is treated much more abstract and
general than in other window managers: A monitor just is a rectangular part of
your screen which shows exactly one tag on it.

Initially there is only one large monitor ranging over your entire screen:

----
$ herbstclient list_monitors
0: 1440x900+0+0 with tag "1" [FOCUS]
----

The output shows that there is only one monitor with index 0 at position +0+0 of
size 1440x900 showing tag 1. In most cases, the herbstluftwm monitors will match
the list of physical monitors. So to add another physical monitor, you have to
perform several steps:

  . Enable it, such that it shows a part of your screen. You can use +xrandr+,
    +xinerama+ or any other tool you like.
  . Register it in herbstluftwm: Lets assume your new monitor has the resolution
    1024x768 and is right of your main screen, then you can activate it via:
+
----
$ herbstclient set_monitors 1440x900+0+0 1024x768+1440+0
----
+
Alternatively, if +xinerama+ or +xrandr+ works for your setup, simply run:
+
----
$ herbstclient detect_monitors
----

For even more automation, you can enable the setting +auto_detect_monitors+.
For more advanced examples, look at the +q3terminal.sh+ example script, which
implements a drop-down-terminal like monitor where you can put any application
you like.
