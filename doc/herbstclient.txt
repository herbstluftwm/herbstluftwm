NAME
----
herbstclient - sends commands to a running herbstluftwm instance via X


SYNOPSIS
--------
*herbstclient* ['OPTIONS'] 'COMMAND' ['ARGS ...']

*herbstclient* ['OPTIONS'] ['--wait'|'--idle'] ['FILTER ...']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Sends a 'COMMAND' with its (optional) arguments 'ARGS' to a running
link:herbstluftwm.html[*herbstluftwm*(1)] instance via Xlib. If 'COMMAND' has an
output, it is printed by *herbstclient*. If output does not end with a newline,
then a newline is added to improve readability.

See link:herbstluftwm.html[*herbstluftwm*(1)] for a list of available
__COMMAND__s and their 'ARGS'.

If '--wait' or '--idle' is passed, then it waits for hooks from *herbstluftwm*.
The hook is printed, if it matches the optional 'FILTER'. __FILTER__s are
regular expressions. For a list of available hooks see *herbstluftwm*(1).

OPTIONS
-------
*-n*, *--no-newline*::
    Do not print a newline if output does not end with a newline.

*-0*, *--print0*::
    Use the null character as delimiter between the output of hooks.

*-l*, *--last-arg*::
    When using *-i* or *-w*, only print the last argument of the hook.

*-i*, *--idle*::
    Wait for hooks instead of executing commands.

*-w*, *--wait*::
    Same as *--idle* but exit after first *--count* hooks.

*-c*, *--count* 'COUNT'::
    Let *--wait* exit after 'COUNT' hooks were received and printed. The default
    'COUNT' is 1.

*-q*, *--quiet*::
    Do not print error messages if herbstclient cannot connect to the running
    herbstluftwm instance.

*-v*, *--version*::
    Print the herbstclient version. To get the herbstluftwm version, use
    *herbstclient version*.

*-h*, *--help*::
    Print the herbstclient usage with its command line options.

*-p*, *--binary-pipe*::
    Run multiple commands via a binary interface. The interface consists of
    null-byte terminated UTF-8 text tokens. The token 'ARG' pushes the next
    token to the next command to be run, and the token 'RUN' runs the command.
    On stdout, the same format applies, and herbstclient will print tokens
    'STDOUT', 'STDERR', 'STATUS', each followed by a text token containing the
    output, error channel, and status code of the executed command.
    After writing 'RUN' and the nullbyte to herbstclient's stdin, do not forget
    to flush! For example:
+
----
printf 'ARG\0echo\0ARG\0hello world\0RUN\0ARG\0get_attr\0ARG\0tags.count\0RUN\0' \
    | herbstclient --binary-pipe \
    | hexdump -C
----

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
DISPLAY::
    Specifies the 'DISPLAY' to use, i.e. where *herbstluftwm*(1) is running.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
Returns the exit status of the 'COMMAND' execution in *herbstluftwm*(1) server.

*0*::
    Success.

other::
    Failure. See link:herbstluftwm.html[*herbstluftwm*(1)] for a list of error
    codes.
