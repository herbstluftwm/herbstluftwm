NAME
----
herbstclient - sends commands to a running herbstluftwm instance via X


SYNOPSIS
--------
*herbstclient* ['OPTIONS'] 'COMMAND' ['ARGS ...']

*herbstclient* ['OPTIONS'] ['--wait'|'--idle'] ['FILTER ...']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Sends a 'COMMAND' with its (optional) arguments 'ARGS' to a running
link:herbstluftwm.html[*herbstluftwm*(1)] instance via Xlib. If 'COMMAND' has an
output, it is printed by *herbstclient*. If output does not end with a newline,
then a newline is added to improve readability.

See link:herbstluftwm.html[*herbstluftwm*(1)] for a list of available
__COMMAND__s and their 'ARGS'.

If '--wait' or '--idle' is passed, then it waits for hooks from *herbstluftwm*.
The hook is printed, if it matches the optional 'FILTER'. __FILTER__s are
regular expressions. For a list of available hooks see *herbstluftwm*(1).

OPTIONS
-------
*-n*, *--no-newline*::
    Do not print a newline if output does not end with a newline.

*-0*, *--print0*::
    Use the null character as delimiter between the output of hooks.

*-l*, *--last-arg*::
    When using *-i* or *-w*, only print the last argument of the hook.

*-i*, *--idle*::
    Wait for hooks instead of executing commands.

*-w*, *--wait*::
    Same as *--idle* but exit after first *--count* hooks.

*-c*, *--count* 'COUNT'::
    Let *--wait* exit after 'COUNT' hooks were received and printed. The default
    'COUNT' is 1.

*-q*, *--quiet*::
    Do not print error messages if herbstclient cannot connect to the running
