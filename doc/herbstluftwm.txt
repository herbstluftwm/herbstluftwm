NAME
----
herbstluftwm - a manual tiling window manager for X


SYNOPSIS
--------
*herbstluftwm* ['OPTION' ...]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Starts the *herbstluftwm* window manager on 'DISPLAY'. It also listens for
calls from *herbstclient*(1) and executes them. The list of available
<<COMMANDS,*COMMANDS*>> is listed below.

'OPTION' can be:

    *-c*, *--autostart* 'PATH'::
        use 'PATH' as autostart file instead of the one in '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME'
    *-v*, *--version*::
        print version and exit
    *--verbose*::
        print verbose information to stderr

TILING ALGORITHM
----------------
The basic tiling concept is, that the layout is represented by a binary tree. On
startup you see one big frame across the entire screen. A frame fulfills
exactly one of the following conditions:

[[LIST_LAYOUT_ALGORITHMS]]
    . Frame contains windows: +
        It shows some clients and arranges them. The current layout algorithms
        are:

        * 0: 'vertical' - clients are placed below each other
        * 1: 'horizontal' - clients are placed next to each other
        * 2: 'max' - all clients are maximized in this frame
        * 4: 'grid' - clients are arranged in an almost quadratic grid

    . Frame is split into subframes: +
        It is split into exactly two *subframes* in a configurable 'fraction'
        either in a vertical or horizontal way. So it produces two *frames*
        which fulfill the same conditions (new frames always are about to
        contain *windows*).

If a new window appears, it is put in the currently focused frame. Only
frames that have the type "contains *windows*" can be focused.

A frame can be removed, so it is merged with its neighbour frame. Due to the
layout structure of a binary tree, each frame (i.e. node in binary tree) has
exactly one neighbour.

The analogy to a binary Tree is explained the best way with a small example:
On startup you have a simple binary tree, with one frame that can contain
clients:

    C

When splitting it (e.g. with command 'split vertical 0.5') you will get this:

    V
   / \
  C   C

You also can split the left frame horizontally and you will get:

     V
    / \
   H   C
  / \
 C   C

If you change the focus to the client on the right and remove this frame, it
will be merged with the left subtree and you will get:

   H
  / \
 C   C

The 'layout' command prints the current layout of all tags as a tree.

TAGS
----
Tags are very similar to workspaces, virtual desktops or window groups. Each
tag has one layout. There is a list of tags. You can add or remove tags
dynamically.

There is also a list of monitors. Each monitor displays exactly one tag on a
specified rectangle on the screen.

[[COMMANDS]]
COMMANDS
--------
// TODO examples in fixed font in html output
*herbstluftwm* is controlled by internal commands, which can be executed via
*herbstclient*(1) or via keybindings.

quit::
    quits herbstluftwm

reload::
    executes the autostart file

version::
    prints the version of the running herbstluftwm instance.

list_commands::
    lists all available commands.

[[list_monitors]]list_monitors::
    list currently configured monitors with their index, area (as rectangle) and currently
    viewed tag.

keybind 'KEY' 'COMMAND' ['ARGS ...']::
    adds a key binding. When 'KEY' is pressed, the internal 'COMMAND' (with its
    'ARGS') is executed. A key binding is a (possibly empty) list of modifiers
    (Mod1, Mod2, Mod3, Mod4, Mod5, Alt, Super, Control/Ctrl, Shift) and one key
    (see keysymdef.h for a list of keys). Modifiers and the key are concatenated
    with '-' or '+' as separator. If there is already a binding for this 'KEY',
    it will be overwritten. Examples:

        * keybind Mod4+Ctrl+q quit
        * keybind Mod1-i toggle always_show_frame
        * keybind Mod1-Shift-space cycle_layout -1

keyunbind 'KEY'::
    removes the key binding for 'KEY'. Syntax for 'KEY' is defined in *keybind*.

spawn 'EXECUTABLE' ['ARGS ...']::
    spawns an 'EXECUTABLE' with its 'ARGS'. For details see 'man 3 execvp'.
    Example:

        * spawn xterm -e man 3 execvp

wmexec ['WINDOWMANAGER' ['ARGS ...']]::
    executes the 'WINDOWMANAGER' with its 'ARGS'. This is useful to switch the
    window manager in the running session without restarting the session. If no
    or an invalid 'WINDOWMANAGER' is given, then herbstluftwm is restarted. For
    details see 'man 3 execvp'. Example:

        * wmexec openbox

cycle ['DELTA']::
    cycles the selection within the current frame by 'DELTA'. If 'DELTA' is
    omitted, 'DELTA' = 1 will be used. 'DELTA' can be negative; 'DELTA' = -1
    means: cycle in the opposite direction by 1.

cycle_all ['DIRECTION']::
    cycles through all windows and frames on the current tag. 'DIRECTION' = 1
    means forward, 'DIRECTION' = -1 means backward, 'DIRECTION' = 0 has no
    effect. 'DIRECTION' defaults to 1. If there are multiple windows within on
    frame, then it acts similar to the 'cycle' command. (The 'cycle_all' command
    focuses the next/previous leave in the 'layout' tree)

cycle_layout ['DELTA']::
    cycles the layout algorithm in the current frame by 'DELTA'. 'DELTA'
    defaults to 1. Currently only 1 is useful because there are only two
    algorithms so far:

        * vertical (below each other)
        * horizontal (next to each other)
        * max (only show selected client in entire frame)
close::
    closes the focused window.

split 'ALIGN' 'FACTION'::
    splits the focused frame into two subframes with a specified 'FRACTION'
    between 0 and 1. 'ALIGN' can be 'horizontal' or 'vertical' (actually it only
    depends on the first letter of 'ALIGN'). Example:

        * split horiz 0.3
        * split vertical 0.5
        * split h 0.8

focus ['-i'|'-e'] 'DIRECTION'::
    moves the focus from current frame to the next frame or client in
    'DIRECTION' which is in:
    +
        * l[eft]
        * r[ight]
        * u[p]
        * d[own]

// small hack to fix indentation of "If ..."
 ::
    If '-i' (internal) is given or default_direction_external_only is unset,
    then the next client in 'DIRECTION' can also be within the same frame. If
    there is no client within this frame or '-e' (external) is given, then the
    next frame in specified 'DIRECTION' will be focused. +
    +
    The direction between frames is defined as follows: The focus is in a leaf
    of the binary tree.  Each inner node in the tree remembers the last focus
    direction (child 0 or child 1). The algorithm is going as short as possible
    from the leaf (the currently focused frame) to the root until it is possible
    to change focus in the specified 'DIRECTION'. From there the focus goes back
    to the leaf. +
    +
    Example: The focus is at frame A. After executing 'focus right' focus will
    be at frame C.

 Tree:  V,0     Screen: .-----..-----. (before)
        / \             |  B  ||  C  |
       /   \            '-----''-----'
     H,1   H,0          .-----..-----.
     / \   / \          |  A* ||  D  |
    A*  B C   D         '-----''-----'

 Tree:  V,0     Screen: .-----..-----. (after focus right)
        / \             |  B  ||  C* |
       /   \            '-----''-----'
     H,1   H,0          .-----..-----.
     / \   / \          |  A  ||  D  |
    A   B C*  D         '-----''-----'

raise ['0xWINID']::
    raises the specified window, which is specified by hexadecimal '0xWINID'. If
    no '0xWINID' is given, the focused window will be raised. Its result is only
    visible in floating mode.

resize 'DIRECTION' 'FRACTIONDELTA'::
    changes the next fraction in specified 'DIRECTION' by 'FRACTIONDELTA'.
    'DIRECTION' is specified at the 'focus' command. You should not omit the
    sign '-' or '+', because in future versions, the behaviour may change if the
    sign is omitted. Example:

        * resize right +0.05
        * resize down -0.1

shift ['-i'|'-e'] 'DIRECTION'::
    shifts the focused window to the next frame in the specified 'DIRECTION'.
    The 'DIRECTIONS' and '-i'|'-e' behave as specified at the 'focus' command.
    If 'focus_follows_shift' is set, then focus stays in the window; otherwise
    it stays in the frame.

remove::
    removes focused frame and merges its windows to its neighbour frame.

set 'NAME' 'VALUE'::
    sets the specified setting 'NAME' to 'VALUE'. All <<SETTINGS,*SETTINGS*>>
    are listed in the <<SETTINGS, section below>>.

get 'NAME'::
    prints the value of setting 'NAME'. All <<SETTINGS,*SETTINGS*>>
    are listed in the <<SETTINGS, section below>>.

toggle 'NAME'::
    toggles the setting 'NAME' if it's an integer setting: if value was 0, it
    becomes 1, else value becomes 0.

cycle_monitor ['DELTA']::
    cycles monitor focused by 'DELTA'. 'DELTA' defaults to 1.

focus_monitor 'INDEX'::
    puts focus to monitor with specified 'INDEX' (as specified by the
    list_monitors command)

add 'TAG'::
    creates a new empty tag named 'TAG'.

use 'TAG'::
    switches focused monitor to specified 'TAG'.

merge_tag 'TAG' ['TARGET']::
    removes tag named 'TAG' and moves all its windows to tag 'TARGET'. If
    'TARGET' is omitted, the focused tag will be used.

rename 'OLDTAG' 'NEWTAG'::
    renames tag named 'OLDTAG' to 'NEWTAG'.

move 'TAG'::
    moves the focused window to tag named 'TAG'.

add_monitor 'RECT' 'TAG' ['PADUP' ['PADRIGHT' ['PADDOWN' ['PADLEFT']]]]::
    adds a monitor on the specified rectangle 'RECT' and displays 'TAG' on it.
    'TAG' currently must not be displayed on any other monitor. 'RECT' is a
    string of the form 'WxH+X+Y'. The padding specifies extra space around the
    monitor for some statusbars/panels. If no or an empty padding is given, it
    is set to 0.  Example:

        * add_monitor 1024x768-20+0 mynewtag 16


remove_monitor 'INDEX'::
    removes the monitor with specified 'INDEX'. Its 'INDEX' can be found out via
    the <<list_monitors,'list_monitors'>> command.

move_monitor 'INDEX' 'RECT' ['PADUP' ['PADRIGHT' ['PADDOWN' ['PADLEFT']]]]::
    moves the monitor with specified 'INDEX' to rectangle 'RECT'. 'INDEX' and
    'RECT' are defined as in 'remove_monitor' and 'add_monitor'. If no or an
    empty pad is given, it is not changed.

monitor_rect [[-p] 'INDEX']::
    prints the rectangle of the specified 'INDEX' in the format: *X Y W H* +
    If no 'INDEX' or 'cur' is given, then the current Monitor is used. If '-p'
    is supplied, then the remaining rect without the pad around this monitor
    is printed.

pad 'INDEX' ['PADUP' ['PADRIGHT' ['PADDOWN' ['PADLEFT']]]]::
    sets the pad of indexed monitor to the specified padding. If no or an empty
    padding is given, it is not changed.

layout ['TAG']::
    prints the layout of 'TAG' in a nice tree style. Its style is defined
    by the 'tree_style' setting. If no 'TAG' is given, current tag is used.
    +
An example output is:
+
----
╾─┐horizontal 50% selection=1
  ├╼ vertical: 0xe00009
  └─┐vertical 50% selection=0
    ├╼ vertical: 0xa00009 [FOCUS]
    └╼ vertical: 0x1000009
----

dump ['TAG']::
    prints the same information as the 'layout' command but in a machine
    readable format. Its output can be read back with the 'load' command.
    +
An example output (formatted afterwards) is:
+
----
(split horizontal:0.500000:1
    (clients vertical:0 0xe00009)
    (splitvertical:0.500000:1
        (clients vertical:0 0xa00009)
        (clients vertical:0 0x1000009)))
----

load ['TAG'] 'LAYOUT'::
    loads a given 'LAYOUT' description to specified 'TAG' or current tag if no
    'TAG' is given.

CAUTION: 'LAYOUT' is exactly one parameter. If you are calling it manually
from your shell or from a script, quote it properly!

complete 'POSITION' ['COMMAND' 'ARGS ...']::
    prints the result of tab completion in partial written 'COMMAND' with
    optional 'ARGS'. You usually do not need this, because there is already tab
    completion for bash. Example:

        * complete 0 m +
          prints all commands beginning with m
        * complete 1 toggle fra +
          prints all settings beginning with fra that can be toggled

emit_hook 'ARGS ...'::
    emits a custom hook to all idling herbstclients.

tag_status ['MONITOR']::
    print a tab separated list of all tags for specified 'MONITOR' index. If no
    'MONITOR' index is given, the focused monitor is used. Each tag name is
    prefixed with one char, which indicates its state:
        * *.* the tag is empty
        * *:* the tag is not empty
        * *+* the tag is viewed on the specified 'MONITOR', but this monitor is
          not focused.
        * *#* the tag is viewed on the specified 'MONITOR' and it is focused.
        * *!* the tag contains an urgent window

WARNING: If you use a tab in one of the tag names, then tag_status is probably
quite useless for you.

floating [['TAG'] on|off|toggle|status]::
    changes the current tag to floating/tiling mode on specified 'TAG' or prints
    it current status. If no 'TAG' is given, current tag is used. If no argument
    is given, floating mode is toggled. If status is given, then on or off is
    printed, depending of the floating state on 'TAG'.

rule [\[--]'FLAG'|\[--]'CONDITION'|\[--]'CONSEQUENCE' ...]::
    defines a rule which will be applied to all new clients. Its behaviour is
    described in the <<RULES,*RULES section*>>.

unrule *--all*|*-F*::
    If --all or -F is passed, then all rules are removed.
    (It is not possible yet to remove certain rules)

fullscreen *on*|*off*|*toggle*::
    sets or toggles the fullscreen state of the focused client.

pseudotile *on*|*off*|*toggle*::
    sets or toggles the pseudotile state of the focused client. If a client is
    pseudotiled, then in tiling mode the client is only moved but not resized -
    the client size will stay the floating size. The only reason to resize the
    client is to ensure, that it fits into its tile.

[[SETTINGS]]
SETTINGS
--------
Settings configure the behaviour of herbstluftwm and can be controlled via the
'set', 'get' and 'toggle' command. There are two types of settings: Strings and
integer values. An integer value is set, if its value is 1 or another value
unequal to 0. An integer value is unset, if its value is 0.

window_gap (Integer)::
    the gap between frames in the tiling mode.

snap_distance (Integer)::
    if a client is dragged in floating mode, then it snaps to neighbour clients
    if the distance between them is smaller then snap_distance.

snap_gap (Integer)::
    specifies the remaining gap if a dragged client snaps to an edge in floating
    mode. If snap_gap is set to 0, no gap will remain.

frame_border_active_color (String/Color)::
    the border color of a focused frame

frame_border_normal_color (String/Color)::
    the border color of an unfocused frame

frame_bg_active_color (String/Color)::
    the fill color of a focused frame

frame_bg_normal_color (String/Color)::
    the fill color of an unfocused frame (It is only visible if
    always_show_frame is set)

frame_bg_transparent (Integer)::
    if set, frames have transparent backgrounds.

frame_border_width (Integer)::
    border width of a frame

raise_on_focus (Integer)::
    if set, a window is raised if it is focused. The value of this setting is
    only noticed in floating mode.

raise_on_click (Integer)::
    if set, a window is raised if it is clicked. The value of this setting is
    only noticed in floating mode.

window_border_width (Integer)::
    border width of a window

window_border_active_color (String/Color)::
    border color of a focused window

window_border_normal_color (String/Color)::
    border color of an unfocused window

always_show_frame (Integer)::
    If set, all frames are displayed. If unset, only frames with focus or with
    windows in it are displayed.

default_frame_layout (Integer)::
    index of the frame layout, which is used if a new frame is created (by split
    or on a new tag). For a list of valid indizes and their meanings, check the
    <<LIST_LAYOUT_ALGORITHMS,list of layout algorithms above>>.

default_direction_external_only (Integer)::
    this setting controls the behaviour of focus and shift if no '-e' or '-i'
    argument is given. if set, then focus and shift changes the focused frame
    even if there are other clients in this frame in the specified 'DIRECTION'.
    Else, a client within current frame is selected if it is in the specified
    'DIRECTION'.

gapless_grid (Integer)::
    this setting affects the size of the last client in a frame that is arranged
    by grid layout. If set, then the last client always fills the gap within
    this frame. If unset, then the last client has the same size as all other
    clients in this frame.

focus_follows_shift (Integer)::
    If set, focus stays in the window, if window is shifted to another frame.
    If unset, focus stays in the frame.

focus_follows_mouse (Integer)::
    If set and a window is focused by mouse cursor, this window is focused (This
    feature is also known as sloppy focus). If unset, you need to click to
    change the window focus by mouse.

swap_monitors_to_get_tag (Integer)::
    If set: If you want to view a tag, that already is viewed on another
    monitor, then the monitor contents will be swapped and you see the wanted
    tag on the focused monitor. If not set, nothing will be swapped.

ignore_class (String/Regex)::
    If the class property of a new created window matches the ignore_class
    regex, then it will not be managed, i.e. will not be put in the layout or on
    tags. Example value: +^(Xfce4-notifyd|Conky)$+

tree_style (String)::
    It contains the chars that are used to print a nice ascii tree. It must
    contain at least 8 characters. e.g. ++X|:#+*-.++ produces a tree like:
+
----
X-.root
  #-.child 0
  | #* child 01
  | +* child 02
  +-.child 1
  : #* child 10
  : +* child 01
----
+
Useful values for 'tree_style' are: +╾│ ├└╼─┐+ or +╾│ ├╰╼─╮+.

[[RULES]]
RULES
-----

Rules are used to change default properties for certain clients when they
appear. Each rule matches against a certain subset of all clients and defines a
set of properties for them (called 'CONSEQUENCES'). A rule can be defined with
this command:

+rule+ [\[--]'FLAG'|\[--]'CONDITION'|\[--]'CONSEQUENCE' ...]

Each rule consists of a list of 'FLAGS', 'CONDITIONS' and 'CONSEQUENCES' (each
of them can be optionally prefixed with two dashes (+--+) to provide a more
*iptables*(8)-like feeling).

If a new client
appears, herbstluftwm tries to apply each rule to this new client as follows:
If each 'CONDITION' of this rule matches against this client, then every
'CONSEQUENCE' is executed. (If there are no conditions given, then this rule
is executed for each client)

Each 'CONDITION' consists of a 'property' name, a operator and a 'value'. Valid
operators are:

    * +~+ matches if client's 'property' is matched by the regex 'value'
    * +=+ matches if client's 'properly' string is equal to 'value'

Valid 'properties' are:

    * +instance+: the first entry in client's +WM_CLASS+
    * +class+: the second entry in client's +WM_CLASS+
    * +pid+: the client's process id (Warning: the pid is not available for
      every client. This only matches if the client sets the pid to the
      _NET_WM_PID itself)
    * +maxage+: matches if the age of the rule measured in seconds does not
      exceed 'value'. This condition only can be used with the +=+ operator. If
      maxage already is exceeded (and never will match again), then this rule is
      removed. (With this you can build rules that only live for a certain time)
    * +windowtype+: matches the _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE property of a window.
    * +windowrule+: matces the WM_WINDOW_ROLE property of a window if it is set
      by the window.

Each 'CONSEQUENCE' consists of a 'NAME'='VALUE' pair.
Valid 'NAMES' are:

    * +tag+: moves the client to tag 'VALUE'
    * +focus+: decides whether the client gets the input focus on his tag.
      The default is *off*.  'VALUE' can be *on*, *off* or *toggle*.
    * +manage+: decides whether the client will be managed or not. The default is
      *on*. 'VALUE' can be *on*, *off* or *toggle*.
    * +index+: moves the window to a specified index in the tree. 'VALUE'
      contains of a list of characters; each of them decides in which subtree
      the window is inserted.

        ** +0+: insert it in the first subtree
        ** +1+: insert it in the second subtree
        ** +.+: insert it in the subtree that has the focus
        ** +/+: insert it in the subtree that has not the focus

    * +pseudotile+: sets the pseudotile state of the client. 'VALUE' can be
      *on*, *off* or *toggle*.
    * +fullescreen+: sets the fullscreen flag of the client. 'VALUE' can be
      *on*, *off* or *toggle*.

A rule's behaviour can be configured by some special 'FLAGS':

    * +not+: negates the next 'CONDITION'
    * +!+: same as +not+
    * +once+: only apply this rule once (and delete it afterwards)

Examples:

    * +rule --class=Netscape --tag=6 --focus=off+ +
        +
        moves all Netscape instances to tag 6, but doesn't give focus to them

    * +rule not class~.*[Tt]erm tag=2+ +
        +
        moves all clients to tag 2, if their class does not end with +term+ or
        +Term+

    * +rule class=Thunderbird index=/0+
        +
        Insert all Thunderbird instances in the tree that has no focus and there
        in the first child.

    * +rule --windowtype=_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG --focus=on+
        +
        Sets focus to new windows if they are dialogs (and set their
        _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE correctly).

AUTOSTART FILE
--------------

There is no config file but an autostart file, which is executed on startup. It
is also executed on command 'reload'. If not specified by the *--autostart*
argument, autostart file is located at '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herbstluftwm/autostart'
or at '~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart'. Normally it consists of a few
*herbstclient* calls.

For a quick install, copy the default autostart file to
'~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart' and make it executable.

HOOKS
-----

On special events, herbstluftwm emits some hooks (with parameters). You can
receive or wait for them with *herbstclient*(1). Also custom hooks can be
emitted with the emit_hook command. The following hooks are emitted by
herbstluftwm itself:

fullscreen [on|off] 'WINID' 'STATE'::
    the fullscreen state of window 'WINID' was changed to [on|off].

tag_changed 'TAG' 'MONITOR'::
    the tag 'TAG' was selected on 'MONITOR'.

tag_flags::
    the flags (i.e. urgent or filled state) have been changed.

tag_added 'TAG'::
    a tag named 'TAG' was added.

tag_removed 'TAG'::
    the tag named 'TAG' was removed.

urgent [on|off] 'WINID'::
    the urgent state of client with given 'WINID' has been changed to [on|off].

There are also other useful hooks, which never will be emitted by herbstluftwm
itself, but which can be emitted with the *emit_hook* command:

quit_panel::
    tells a panel to quit. The default panel.sh quits on this hook. Many
    scripts are using this hook.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
DISPLAY::
    specifies the 'DISPLAY' to use.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
Always returns *0*.
